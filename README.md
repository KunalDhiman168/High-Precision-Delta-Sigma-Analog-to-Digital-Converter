# High-Precision Delta-Sigma ADC (16+ ENOB) | Inter-IIT Tech Meet Project

## Introduction
High-precision data conversion is a critical requirement in space-grade applications such as communication, navigation, remote sensing, and human spaceflight. This project focuses on the **design and implementation of a high-resolution Delta-Sigma Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)** targeted for **low-bandwidth, high-accuracy sensor interfaces**, aligning with indigenous VLSI development goals under **Atmanirbhar Bharat**.

The work involves **system-level modeling, digital backend design, noise analysis, and ASIC implementation**, demonstrating an end-to-end mixed-signal design flow.
